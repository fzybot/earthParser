# earthParser
The project is aimed to get the geographical data from web pages (like goole maps, yandex maps, OSM, etc.).
For now I'm only trying to get the elevation for particular lon lat values.
TODO:
  1. Get the buildings height
  2. Understand is it a building or something else at particular coordinates.
